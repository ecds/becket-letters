          "profile": "Kay Boyle (1902-1992), writer, teacher, and activist was born in St Paul, Minnesota, and educated in the United States, but from 1923 spent more than twenty years living and working in Europe. She married several times, to Richard Brault, Laurence Vail, and to Joseph von Frankenstein; she had six children with them and a relationship with Ernest Walsh. Boyle joined the expatriate, largely American literary community of Paris, where she met, among others, Eugene and Maria Jolas, Peggy Guggenheim, and Robert McAlmon, with whom she wrote Being Geniuses Together, a light-hearted, insider’s view of that world. Unlike many in it, such as Djuna Barnes or Nancy Cunard, she was a prolific writer: novels (14), short story collections, and books of verse (her Collected Poems was published in 1991), as well as essays and newspaper articles. She was on good terms with SB, though never as close to him as she might have liked. Both were contributors in the 1930s to transition, the ambitiously avant-garde review edited by the Jolases. As well as occasionally meeting, they later corresponded on literary matters. Over the years, Boyle’s increasing involvement in political and social campaigns (she was an early and vociferous opponent of McCarthyism and of American policy in Vietnam, often in trouble for her beliefs) allowed less time for travel, and of course took her farther away from SB’s world. She had returned to the United States and, after some years on the East Coast, became Professor of English at San Francisco State College from 1963 to 1979. A misunderstanding over a lecture (on a Joyce short story, “The Boarding House”) that she had sent to SB, had, when cleared up, the effect of closing the gap, as the increasing range and warmth of the letters between them clearly shows. These move in style from cautious and distance-preserving (“Dear Kay Boyle”) to affectionate and sympathetic, whether about her health or changes in her personal circumstances - changes that were often the consequence of her political activism.
